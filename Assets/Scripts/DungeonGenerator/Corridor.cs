/*
 *  This class is used to define a connection between Rooms in a Dungeon.  Corridors are axis-aligned rectangles.  There is no provision for 
 *  Corridors that have turns in them.  
 *  
 *  If you wanted to make a corridor with a 90-degree turn you could potentially make two that connect to a 
 *  CorridorWidthxCorridorWidth room in the middle.
 *  
 *  The primary way of creating Corridors and Rooms (and Dungeons) is through the DungeonGenerator.  The class is simple and open-ended enough that
 *  they could be created in other ways, though.
