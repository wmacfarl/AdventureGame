/*
 *  This class defines a node in a 2D Binary Space Partition tree which describes the layout of a Dungeon.
 *  
 *  Each Dungeon has a RootRegion that doesn't have any siblings.  This region is divided into two DungeonRegions that are siblings of eachother and
 *  are SubRegions of the RootRegion.  SubRegions are recursively divided into smaller and smaller pairs.
 *  
 *  The last level of DungeonRegions are called the "leaf" regions.  They are not divided and don't have any SubRegions.  Each leaf region contains
 *  a Room.
 *  
 *  Dungeons are divided into DungeonRegions structured as a Binary Space Partitioning Tree.  Every leaf-node in the tree contains a Room.
 *  
 *  Presently the BSP tree structure is only being used for generating the Dungeon and ensuring full-connectivity between rooms.  It could potentially
 *  be used for gameplay logic as well because the speed of traversing a BSP tree is quite fast.
